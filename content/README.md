## About Dolt Solutions
This documentation is about how to make use of Dolt in production settings. Being a general purpose database, you can more or less use Dolt wherever a relational database might be useful. Dolt compromises on performance to deliver powerful Git-like verison control featuers alongside the well known MySQL dialect. This documentation provides concrete examples of where Dolt's unique features have motivated users to adopt it in a production setting.

We cover a combination of abstract use-cases and specific case-studies, including [network automation](case-studies/network-automation-with-nautobot-and-dolt.md).
